# Cloud Data Engineer Roadmap – Learning Log

This repository tracks my journey to become a Cloud/Data Engineer.  
Here I store notes, practice exercises and small projects built while studying SQL, Python, ETL and data warehousing.

## About me

- Name: Pedro Jorge Delgadillo Villarroel

## Goals

**Short term (3–6 months)**  
- Strengthen SQL for analytics and data engineering.  
- Build solid foundations in Python for data and ETL.  
- Design and implement small end-to-end data pipelines.

**Mid term (6–12 months)**  
- Be ready to apply for remote junior Data Engineer / Cloud Data Engineer roles.  
- Create 3–5 portfolio projects showing real data workflows (ingestion, storage, transformation, analytics).

## Repository structure

Planned structure for this repo:

- `courses/` – Notes and practice from online courses.
- `projects/` – Small data engineering projects based on what I learn.
- `daily-log/` – Daily or weekly learning log (what I studied, links, ideas, doubts).

This structure will evolve as I progress.

## Progress tracker

**Completed**

- [x] DataCamp – Associate Data Engineer in SQL (certificate).
- [x] DataCamp – Introduction to Python (basic Python course).

**In progress**

- [ ] DataCamp – Intermediate Python.
- [ ] Data Engineering core skills (data modeling, database design, ETL).
- [ ] Data warehousing and cloud data engineering topics.

I update this list as I advance.

## Daily learning log

I use this repo not only to store code, but also to document my process.  
The idea is to regularly push:

- New notes from courses.  
- SQL practice files.  
- Python scripts for ETL and data cleaning.  
- Reflections about what I learned each week.

This way anyone can see my evolution over time, not just the final projects.
