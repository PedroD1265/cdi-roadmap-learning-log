# Cloud/Data Engineer Learning Roadmap 🚀

Welcome to my learning journey to become a Cloud/Data Engineer! This repository tracks my progress, courses, projects, and daily study logs.

## 🎯 Goals

- Master cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Build expertise in data engineering tools and technologies
- Develop production-ready data pipelines
- Learn Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)
- Understand distributed systems and big data processing
- Build a portfolio of real-world data engineering projects

## 🗺️ Roadmap
