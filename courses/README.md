# Courses – Notes and Practice

This folder contains detailed notes, summaries, and practice exercises from the courses I complete as part of my Cloud/Data Engineer roadmap.  
The goal is to document my learning process clearly, track my progress over time, and build a solid technical foundation across the key areas of data engineering.

Inside this directory, I organize my course notes by topic or platform, including but not limited to:

- **SQL Fundamentals & Advanced SQL** – Joins, aggregations, window functions, subqueries, data cleaning, query optimization, and analytical problem-solving.
- **Python for Data Engineering** – Data types, functions, error handling, file processing, ETL scripting, working with libraries such as `pandas`, and building modular code.
- **Data Warehousing Concepts** – Dimensional modeling, star and snowflake schemas, facts and dimensions, OLAP vs. OLTP, and data architecture fundamentals.
- **Cloud & Modern Data Stack Tools** – Introductory materials on Airflow, dbt, Snowflake, and other components of a modern data pipeline (added as I progress).

Each course may include:
- Concept explanations and summaries.  
- My own notes and interpretations.  
- Practice SQL queries or Python code.  
- Realistic exercises inspired by professional data engineering workflows.  
- Reflections on what I learned and what I still need to improve.

This folder will be continuously updated as I advance through my self-paced learning journey.  
It serves both as a personal study archive and as transparent evidence of my long-term commitment to becoming a Cloud/Data Engineer.
