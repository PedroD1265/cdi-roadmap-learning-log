# Daily Log – 2025-12-09

## Overview
Today I set up the foundation of my learning repository for the Cloud/Data Engineer roadmap.  
The main objective of the day was to establish a clean structure that will serve as the central place to track my study progress, document insights, and store practice exercises.

## What I accomplished today

### 🔹 1. Created the main learning repository
- Set up the `cdi-roadmap-learning-log` repo on GitHub.
- Added initial files (`README.md` and `.gitignore`) and configured the project structure.
- Defined the purpose of the repository: tracking my journey, documenting notes, and creating portfolio-ready projects.

### 🔹 2. Wrote and published an extended README
- Added a clear description of my goals, timeline, and learning strategy.
- Added sections for:
  - Short-term and mid-term goals  
  - Repository structure  
  - Progress tracker  
  - Learning philosophy  
- This sets the tone for the entire project and gives future recruiters a clear picture of my direction.

### 🔹 3. Created the `courses/` and `daily-log/` directories
- Set up the folders that will store my notes and daily progress.
- Added the first README to `courses/` with a detailed explanation of how I will organize notes and practice.

### 🔹 4. Python courses studied today

- **DataCamp – Introduction to Python for Developers**
  - Started the course and completed.
  - Reviewed what Python is, how to run and write simple scripts, and how variables and basic data types work.

- **DataCamp – Intermediate Python (Functions chapter)**
  - Worked through Chapter 1 focused on defining custom functions.
  - Practiced writing functions to calculate the average of a list of values.
  - Reviewed the DRY principle (“Don’t repeat yourself”) and when it makes sense to create custom functions instead of repeating logic or relying only on built-in code.

## Learnings and reflections
- Building a well-structured GitHub repo is a key part of presenting myself professionally as an aspiring Cloud/Data Engineer.  
- Today’s work clarifies my long-term vision and gives me a space to document consistent progress.
- Having a structure makes learning more intentional and easier to maintain.
- Combining GitHub practice with Python courses helps connect theory with real, trackable work.

## Next steps (for tomorrow)
- Add the first SQL or Python course notes in `courses/`.
- Push the first small practice exercise (SQL or Python script, simple but real).
- Create the `projects/` folder README with a plan for the first portfolio project.
- Begin planning the first mini-project (ETL pipeline or SQL model).

## Status
✔ Repository created  
✔ README completed  
✔ Folder structure initialized  
✔ Python learning sessions logged  
❗ Ready to begin adding technical content starting tomorrow
