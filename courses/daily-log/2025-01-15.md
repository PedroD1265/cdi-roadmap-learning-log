## Today’s activities (2026-01-14)

### 1) Google Cloud Skills Boost (Arcade) — Looker
**Lab completed:** *Troubleshooting Data Models in Looker* (GSP1019)

**What I practiced**
- Used SQL Runner to debug tables/columns and create a **SQL derived table** (`user_order_lifetime`).
- Used LookML Validator to detect and fix syntax and join issues.
- Used Explore + SQL tab to diagnose joins and `primary_key` problems.
- Used Content Validator to update Looks after field renames.

### 2) DataCamp — Introduction to GitHub Concepts (Updated: Mar 2025)
**Progress:** Chapter 1 up to **“Creating a README”** (stopped here).  
**Status:** In progress (not completed).

## Next steps (next session)
- DataCamp: continue *Introduction to GitHub Concepts* from **“Creating a README”** and finish Chapter 1.
- Looker: write down 3 troubleshooting “rules” (joins/PK/validators) and apply them to a small personal example.
- Azure ETL workshop: define Bronze/Silver/Gold transformations and start Bronze → Silver (cleaning + typing + schema).
