## Overview
Today I worked on two main areas of my Cloud/Data Engineer roadmap:
1. Setting up and structuring my public learning repository on GitHub.
2. Starting and completing the first module of the Coursera course “Python for Data Science, AI & Development”.

The goal of the day was to connect my learning progress with a clear public trace (GitHub) and deepen my Python foundations for data and AI.

## What I accomplished today

### 🔹 1. Structured my learning repository on GitHub
- Reviewed my GitHub profile and created the repository **`cdi-roadmap-learning-log`**.
- Defined the purpose of the repo: to track my journey towards Cloud/Data Engineering with notes, practice, and projects.
- Planned the high-level structure with folders like:
  - `courses/` – notes and practice from courses.
  - `projects/` – small data engineering projects.
  - `daily-log/` – daily learning logs.

### 🔹 2. Wrote and refined repository documentation
- Drafted and improved the main `README.md` to:
  - Introduce who I am and what I am aiming for.
  - Describe my short-term and mid-term goals as an aspiring Cloud/Data Engineer.
  - Explain how the repository will be organized.
  - Set up a progress tracker for courses and projects.
- Created a description for `courses/README.md` explaining how course notes and exercises will be stored and organized.

### 🔹 3. Started Coursera – “Python for Data Science, AI & Development”
- Began the IBM/Coursera course and completed the **first module**.
- Topics and items completed today include:
  - **Course introduction and overview**
    - Course Introduction
    - About this course
    - Course Overview
    - Helpful Tips for Course Completion
  - **Introduction to Python and Jupyter**
    - Introduction to Python (video)
    - Introduction to Jupyter (video/reading)
    - Getting Started with Jupyter (reading)
    - Hands-on Lab: Write Your First Program (basic `print`, running code in Jupyter)
  - **Python basics: types, expressions and variables**
    - Types (video)
    - Hands-on Lab: Types
    - Practice Quiz: Types
    - Expressions and Variables (video)
    - Hands-on Lab: Expressions and Variables
    - Practice Quiz: Expressions and Variables
- By the end of the session, I finished the first module of the course, reinforcing core Python concepts in a data/AI context.

## Learnings and reflections
- Having a dedicated GitHub repo for my learning journey helps me stay accountable and creates visible evidence of my progress for future employers.
- Using structured notes and daily logs forces me to slow down and summarize what I actually understood, not just what I “completed”.
- The first module of “Python for Data Science, AI & Development” connects basic Python concepts with tools I’ll keep using later (especially Jupyter notebooks).

## Next steps (for upcoming days)
- Add the first course notes under `courses/` for:
  - “Python for Data Science, AI & Development – Module 1”.
- Start Module 2 of the Coursera course and continue building Python skills for data work.
- Create a `projects/README.md` with a plan for the first small data engineering project (e.g., a simple ETL pipeline using Python).
- Maintain this `daily-log` folder with consistent entries to show long-term commitment.

## Status
✔ GitHub learning repository created and structured  
✔ Main documentation drafted (README + courses description)  
✔ First module of “Python for Data Science, AI & Development” completed  
❗ Next: start adding concrete notes, scripts, and small projects to turn this into a strong public portfolio
