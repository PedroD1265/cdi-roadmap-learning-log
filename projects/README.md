# 💼 Data Engineering Projects

This folder contains hands-on projects that demonstrate my data engineering skills and knowledge.

## 🎯 Project Categories

### ETL/ELT Pipelines
- Build data pipelines to extract, transform, and load data
- Examples: CSV to database, API to data warehouse, batch processing

### Data Warehousing
- Design and implement data warehouse solutions
- Examples: Star schema design, dimensional modeling, OLAP cubes

### Stream Processing
- Real-time data processing projects
- Examples: Kafka streams, event-driven architectures

### Cloud Infrastructure
- Infrastructure as Code projects
- Examples: Terraform deployments, CloudFormation stacks

### Data Quality & Testing
- Data validation and testing frameworks
- Examples: Great Expectations, dbt tests

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project should have its own folder with:
- `README.md` - Project overview and documentation
- `src/` - Source code
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests
- `docs/` - Additional documentation
- `data/` - Sample data (if applicable)
- `config/` - Configuration files
